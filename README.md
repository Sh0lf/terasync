### A2 ISEP Web Tech project ###
This is the A2 fourth-year ISEP web tech project of 2023-2024.
Initial idea is to create a ticket management app (like Jira)

May be bound to a new subject.

Organized under 2 categories :
- "front" = frontend framework Angular
- "backend" = backend framework springboot - mvn

## Why maven ? ##
It's the most common and sperad out config format. Extensions config and handling is way easier to work under xml as it is the reference for almost every dev resources online.

## Samples / examples ##
Added Angular and Springboot - mvn + Springboot - gradle examples under JDK21 in the git for better observability and reference. Created using the "ng new ..." Angular CLI command and the Springboot initializr.

To beware for Angular sample project, as it should contain the node_modules:
